## Projects
### Autonomous Drone for Dynamic Smoke Plume Tracking
[Project](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048) | [Github](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048) | [Paper](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

An autonomous drone controller, trained via a custom PPO-based deep reinforcement learning framework integrated with YOLO-based smoke segmentation, trained on Unreal Engine simulation,  and deployed on Pixhawk quadcopter (equipped with Jetson Orin), for robust dynamic smoke plume tracking in the unsteady wind, improving tracking efficiency (vs PID) by 15%.

### Autonomous 3D Reconstruction of Target Object using Drone Imagery
[Project](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240) | [Github](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048) | [Presentation](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

A drone autonomously captures images of a target object from optimal positions, performing a circular flight path. The images are processed through a pipeline that sorts them by blurriness to generate the camera trajectory using COLMAP. This trajectory and the corresponding images are then fed into a modified NeRF model — featuring an updated MLP architecture, encoding, and learning parameters — optimized specifically for drone imagery, resulting in a high-fidelity 3D reconstruction.
